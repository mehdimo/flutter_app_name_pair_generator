# flutter_app_word_pair_generator

A new Flutter project to generate random word pairs.


The code is developed based on [codelab](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) thanks to [Filip Hracek](https://github.com/filiph).

`flutter_tts` package is used to say the words. 
   - Known issue: the tts may not work on devices; but works on web target.
